            <h2 class="contact-tit">Summer Internship:</h2>
            <p>
                During my summer internship, I had the opportunity to participate in a volunteer program where I was able to gain professional experience in a real-world setting. This experience allowed me to observe and take part in various technical tasks that gave me valuable insights into the industry. My main goal was to explore the internship environment and understand how professional teams operate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was actively involved in various stages of the internship, from learning new technologies to applying them in real projects. I particularly enjoyed working on tasks that required problem-solving and technical creativity, giving me a sense of accomplishment.

            <h2 class="contact-tit">Internship Objectives:</h2>
            <p>
                One of the primary objectives of my internship was to work on light modeling and testing. I used SolidWorks to create models for different lighting systems and experimented with various configurations to see their effectiveness in real-world conditions. I collaborated with senior engineers to refine the models and optimize their designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in testing the models to evaluate their performance, focusing on aspects like energy efficiency, light intensity, and durability. This was done using advanced simulation tools and testing setups.

            <h2 class="contact-tit">Testing Light Intensity:</h2>
            <p>
                To measure the light intensity of the systems we designed, we utilized cutting-edge technology such as the integrating sphere. The testing process involved placing the light sources inside the sphere and measuring the output under controlled conditions to analyze their efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we tested the lights in a darkroom to simulate real-world conditions and ensure the lighting models were effective in various environments. This was an exciting and challenging aspect of the internship, as it involved applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
